ReddiTab Comments - Chrome Extension
========

Always open Reddit comment pages in new tabs (duplicates existing Reddit feature)

I know this feature already exists (in Reddit's preferences), but I wanted to experiment with Chrome Content Scripts.

See [instructions here](http://lifehacker.com/5919997/how-to-install-extensions-that-arent-from-the-official-chrome-web-store)
on how to install in Chrome.
